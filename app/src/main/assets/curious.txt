Imagine if life was a game?
Imagine if all this is fake?
Imagine if everything ended
And we go to heaven
And meet all the greats?
Imagine if there was no Drake?
Imagine if there was no Wayne?
Would rappers be garbage?
Would people be rapping?
Will everyone still sound the same?
Man, nobody knows it
All of a sudden
I'm overthinking
Sound like I'm trippin'
Can't tell the states
Feel like I'm goin' Lindsay
Taste of fluoride in this water I'm drinkin'
I don't know why I don't make friends in this business
Seem like they all wanna win but not with me
Went to a party in hopes for some kisses
Girl and their friends and they looking delicious
I came out to 'em
There was four of 'em
There was one of me
I liked all of 'em
They liked none of me
All this bubblin' got me stumblin'
Talked more with the one girl with the pretty fit
'Cause I saw through her and the wall she built
She actin' all that her friends all wack
I asked why she being cold to me
And she said she "don't like guys like me"
Oh, you mean smart and funny and has a big dick
And doesn't have to fake shit just to fit in
Maybe when I meant to be acquaintin'
5'9", confidence through the roof
Not to mention I'm 19 so are you
We both still got lips let's put it to use
And we smashed that night,
She gave me the flu, ayy (That shit was not worth it)
I got sick and sad, man, you gave me the blues
I started thinkin' 'bout life, all the shit I've been through
At fourteen when I didn't have friends at school
Or when I thought nachos was Italian food
When I thought smoking cigarettes would make me cool
All the nights that I spent in my room
I guess we can always improve
I miss my family, miss my home
Wish I could visit a little more
The journey's 24 hours flight too long
I only get to see 'em on my phone
Time does fly
I went from good ones to seeing tears in my mom's eyes
I don't blame her though
She used to feed me, now I live alone
Doing things she don't know about
But I'm always a angel (always a angel)
And I wonder what my mom was thinkin'
When she realised that her son is a little too famous
A little too anxious
Went from having no friends now he's singing on stages
I'm her youngest son
She's just hoping that I know what to do with my paper
When I think about it, shit
I don't know how I could live with that
And I just bought some shit at the grocery
Some coconut water and some frozen meat
Sometimes I still miss the nicotine
I've been nervous and vomiting
Doing shows don't even sound fun to me
Told the crowd that I have food poisoning
Had a trash can sided at the stage for me
Man, I don't know what happened to me
But I think I'm right where I'm supposed to be
I think it's meant to be, I mean, I think I'm meant to be
Put a kid with a dream in a room full of books
He gon' read even though none of it's understood (ayy)
Shout out to the ones doing things
Everyone was afraid or unable to do, man
The world needs more of you, the world needs more like you
And I heard that the simplest choice that you choose
Ain't simple, it's actually huge
And the older I get and the more that I shoot
Don't believe in the hate just believe in the truth
I don't spend the bread I just know how to chase it
If the difference is then here I make it
No I do not live for validation
Fuck your comments and your mama's basement
Always rich cause that's what my name is
Greatest days are on a daily basis
RZA's fuckin' with me, man I made it
If I could man I would never change shit
