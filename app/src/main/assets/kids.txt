Ayy, uh
I'm puttin' numbers on the board and blowin' more digits
I haven't started, man, these are just the before pictures
Shout out my parents, my mother gave birth to four winners
All of the players in the game, it's always cold benches
Been in the studio, I forgot how to sleep
Not tryna make an album they forget 'bout in a week
They said the fruit never gon' fall far from the tree
I used to be the kid, now the kids wanna be me
Trippin' 'bout my future like way before there was cameras
Hella plans on my calendar 'fore I went all professional
Less souls to trust, man, these people makin' me cynical
More copycats and less people soundin' original
Same destination, we just took different routes
Fuck bein' one the greatest, I'm tryna be the greatest one
I ain't sayin' I ain't grateful for everything I've become
But the throne is more comfortable than this chair I'm sittin' on
My name is Brian, cold bars is what I'm known for
If my vision is scarin' me, then I don't go for it
'Member my first days here when it was all foreign
Now I'm on TV with James Corden, that shit was crazy
Just got a place with a backyard, I feel amazing
Nothin' can get between me and the dreams I'm chasin'
Ain't got the time for partyin', no more gettin' wasted
Unless you got the 1942, man, then get the chaser
You hatin' on me, but you know I gotta
You big in your city, I'm the king of a continent
These rappers tryna make the trendin' topic
Why the state of music goin' south?
But I don't even want to talk about it
Let's talk about it, nah, let's talk about it
Before all these folks decide it's cool to give a fuck about it
Everyone's tryna make hits, I'm just tryna make music
You know, the kind that makes you feel when you listen to it?
I'm the youngest child, I don't need more attention
You writin' some bullshit, I write the lyrics meant for the captions
I'm makin' songs that'll probably outlive us for generations
Started off as the sailor, look at me, now I'm the captain
I won't lie, this shit is fun
Tell these Asian kids they could do what they want
Might steal the mic at the Grammy's just to say we won
That everyone can make it, don't matter where you from
Can't forget about the day that Sean called me
Talkin' 'bout a vision called 88 that he's dreamin'
Man, I love him like a brother, if we fall, we gon' recover
Just a man with a vision who mastered in causin' trouble (You can't see)
Man, I can't see the finish line
Fall back, fall back, I ain't fuckin' 'round this time (Anymore)
Did God know he created a legend in '99? (Anymore)
Fuck pretendin' on a track, man, I mean every single line
Touched down, never holdin' back
Shinin' like some bustdown, sailin' 'round without a map
Been a underdog, now it's time to let me quarterback
Killin' shit in uncharted territories, man this shit get hella gory
Whole country of people proud, so I'm never worried
Glad you're sittin' through the credits, man, this is my story
The type of shit that make me cry when I record it
This the type of shit that still gon' make me cry even when I'm 40
R.I.P. Nipsey, R.I.P. Mac
These inspirations always gon' motivate me to rap
Let's celebrate their lives and the people that they impact
The marathon continues, ain't no way we lookin' back
Amazon Prime flow, you know I'll always deliver
We crossed oceans for a chance just to feel somethin' better
Generations to sacrifice, that we'll always remember
It's that circle of life shit, they hold me up like I'm Simba
They told me I ain't welcome, I'm here to stay, and my visa says so
Just wait and see who's songs they gon' blast up in they headphones
Come back like every couple years to destroy like tornadoes
Victorious tropical flow comin' straight from Indo'
These plants only grow to just get cut and disposed
Their spotlight is dimmin', my future's so bright that it glows
You want the blueprint for impossible, I'll let it show
Remember when Pac said, "The concrete grows a rose"
